## About the project
The project started with the motivation of learning game development with python. 

It is the first computer game I have programmed. Since I am a beginner, I decided to implement it without Object-oriented programming. In the next version I will implement it with Object-oriented programming.


## Built with

- [**Python**](https://www.python.org)
- [**Pygame**](https://www.pygame.org)


## Getting Started
